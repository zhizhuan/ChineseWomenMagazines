nzsj002,nzsj_vol001_issue01.jpg,Discussing Freedom in Marriage,image/jpeg,"content: Free marriage is not something that can be easily achieved. Women in Chinese society have long been restricted by outdated customs, viewed as ""things"", which is truly regrettable. Free marriage requires individuals to be self-disciplined and economically independent. Those who cannot support themselves are neither able to enjoy the freedom of marriage nor should they seek it. If a marriage is not built on true love between both parties, it will not only harm their feelings but also bring negative effects to their family, nation, ethnicity, and society. Therefore, the issue of free marriage deserves in-depth study.",Zhuang Gong,1904,no,Nüzi Shijie (Women's World) ,"Beijing,CN",39.9042,116.4074,University of Heidelberg,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

nzsj003,nzsj_vol001_issue02.jpg,Prohibition of Women from Foot Binding,image/jpeg,"content: When Governor Zhou served as the provincial governor of Dong Province, he issued strict orders prohibiting women from foot binding. In Dong Province, this ban had already been enforced. However, in the Jiangnan region, from Governor Wei to Governor Duan, these officials had all issued proclamations urging people to stop foot binding, yet this outdated and deeply rooted practice has not been completely eradicated. Recently, Governor Zhou reiterated the ban, explicitly forbidding foot binding. However, without local gentry and women from officials' families taking the lead in advocating against it, relying solely on official proclamations will likely be ineffective.",Pan Huayu,1904,no,Nüzi Shijie (Women's World) ,"Beijing,CN",39.9042,116.4074,University of Heidelberg,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.
